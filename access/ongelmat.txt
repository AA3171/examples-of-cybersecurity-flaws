1. Broken access control. Allows posting when not logged in (views.py)
The fix forces you to log in, when opening the posting site, while 
the unfixed simply hides the link to the posting site, which can be
avoided by going to the URL directly. 

2. Insecure design. This site has no standards for passwords. It can
be just a single letter. (settings.py)

3. Vulnerable and Outdated Components. Password hashing is done with
old and outdated MD5 (settings.py)

4. CSRF checks have been disabled (settings.py)

5. Injection. Site is vulnerable against XSS (access.html and views.py)
